business model:

website creation is free

monthly maintenance is $200 a month/flat* (all problems and issues; just contact me and I will take care of it)
this is flat unless scaling is needed, at which point the AWS needs will be a seperately invoiced item that Darly can then upload his own credit card credentials into (or maybe Anthony can require reimbursement for monthly fees)





notes:

User model, LoginUser model, Profile model?, Comment model?, 


Order model should include all possible ordered items?




colors:

#FE1216 - red
#F8C20D - yellow




Resources needed from Alex:
